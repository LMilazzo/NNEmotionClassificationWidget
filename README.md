This is a pretty simple dashboard to iteract with my torch/luz emotion classification model. 

Download the repository, unzip the embedding dictionary, and run either app.R or server.R to start the shiny app. 

Type your text into the left-hand sidebar and view the classification probabilities on the right. The text input is truncated or padded to exactly 30 tokens.
